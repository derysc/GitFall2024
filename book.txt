The last full book I read was maybe in middle school and I do not remember any of it. I normally just skim any material I need to read for class. The last one I got close to finishing was a required book in my First-Year Seminar class. I do not remember the name but it was about a hispanic girl that was talking about her immigration to the U.S. and how God was apart of that transition. That's about all I remember thank you!

Step 10
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:

	.gitignore
	book.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Step 17
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   book.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
